# Change Log

## v0.2.51

- Add quotes to describe and test, add testc, i.e. `test "name of text", %{conn: conn} do ... end`

## v0.2.50

- add two new snippets: mp, for Map.put/3, and: mpn, for Map.put_new/3

## v0.2.40

- Add a snippet for inspecting stacktraces #21. Thank you @s3cur3

## v0.2.39

- Fix trailing comma #20. Thank you @easink

## v0.2.38

- new regex formula for using the RELATIVE_FILEPATH instead of the TM_FILEPATH variable. This matches any level of nested folders (see William's question in [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69145815/vs-code-snippet-regex-for-relative-path)). Removed the "Test" at the end of the "ExUnit" snippet because as a (opinionated) convention the file name includes "\_test" at the end of the file and included the prefix ":", useful when the key and value are the same. Thank you @williamthome

## v0.2.37

- `pry` snippet, thank you @PJUllrich

## v0.2.36

- readme format fix

## v0.2.35

- New snippet: `iins`; `IO.inspect` with a label containing relative path and line number. Label string can easily be discarded
  inspired bby this [tip](https://elixirstream.dev/tips/7bca7ae3-1431-4bb1-bf2c-1ee3c5390a40) I added my own take on it. Hopefully you can enjoy this newer version as much as I do :)

- new snippet: `mfs`, Map from Struct
- new snippet: `msan`, sanitize a Map, by dropping some of its keys

## v0.2.29

- New snippet: `iill`
  An `IO.inspect` with an optional custom message, displaying the file path relative to the app's root folder and the line number in the code where the inspect is defined. If your shell supports it, i.e. iTerm2, then you're just one-click away from jumping to the exact line in the code, where the inspect is. No more searching for forgotten inspects!
